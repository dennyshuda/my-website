        Hello! I'm Denny. I am a Frontend Developer based in Indonesia. There
        are a lot of things and technologies to learn in Frontend Development
        and I am motivated to learn as much as possible. I enjoy learning
        something new and getting feedback to make myself better and improve. On
        this website I will write several blogs and showcase my projects. I
        believe that by posting my work it is the best way to share my knowledge
        along the way. So give me a call and I'll be happy to help!
